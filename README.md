## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using R, I designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.
